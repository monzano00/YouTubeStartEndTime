# YouTubeStartEndTime
Android Application that lets you put in almost any youtube.com link and a start and end time to the video and it will return a link that just shows the clip of the video you wanted to show. It also works if you just want to set an end time for the video or a start time for the video. Putting in a link without setting a start and/or end time will return the link for the video if it was on a different platform (ex: putting in the link for a youtube video you got from sharing on mobile will give you the web url for the video).

To find the apk, download the apk from https://github.com/monzano00/YouTubeStartEndTime/tree/master/app/release
